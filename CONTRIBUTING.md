# Notes for HackShare Contributors

All contributions, bug reports, bug fixes, documentation improvements, enhancements, and ideas are always welcome.

## Working on an issue

If you are new to open source then we highly recommend you going through the GitHub [issues](https://github.com/eKhattak/hackshare/issues) tab to find issues that interests you. If you decide to work on an issue it’s always a good idea to assign the issue to yourself, so nobody else duplicates the work on it. If for any reason you are not able to continue working on the issue, please make sure to unassign yourself.


## Filing an Issue

#### Bug Report

Before opening a new issue try searching the existing issues to see if someone else has already noticed the same problem.

If the issue has not been reported then while filing a bug report, provide where possible:

- The full error message
- Steps to follow to reproduce the error

Note: When pasting code blocks or output, put triple backquotes (```) around the text so GitHub will format it nicely.

#### Feature Enhancement

To any feature request, provide where possible:

- If feature request is related to a problem please provide a clear and concise description of what the problem is.
- A concise description of what you want to happen.
- A concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered.

## Contributor Checklist

- Create a Github account.

- Fork HackShare.

This will create a copy of HackShare repository which will help you experiment with changes without affecting the original project. 

Detailed guide on how to fork a repository can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo).

- Create a branch.

You want your master branch to reflect only production-ready code, so create a feature branch for making your changes.
